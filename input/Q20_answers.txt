Graph one shows the length of two springs, P and Q which changed when loads were hung from them. Based on graph 1, which spring P or Q can be stretched more easily? Give a reason for your answer.
P can be stretched more easily as it increased in lenght more than Q even though both had the same loads hung on them.
