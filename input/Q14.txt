%%right
There are fewer plants in the pond to photosynthesise and produce oxeygen.
The oxegen level decreased as there were fewer plants in the pond to photosynthesise and produce oxeygen.
Since there were fewer plants to photosynthesise and produce oxeygen, the oxeygen level in the pond decreased.
%%wrong
The smell was so bad the oxeygen didn't want to come to the pond.
The oxeygen didn't come because there were no plants.
